6402.jpg	- A 2D grid of size 5x5 is given, where each cell contains a unique integer from 1 to 25. The grid is represented as a list of lists in Python. Write a Python function that takes this grid as input and returns a new grid where each cell contains the sum of its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). If a cell is on the edge of the grid, it should only consider the existing adjacent cells. For example, given the following grid:

grid = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
    [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
    [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
    [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]
]

The function should return the following grid:

[
    [28, 36, 44, 52, 60],
    [64, 76, 88, 100, 112],
    [76, 88, 100, 112, 124],
    [88, 100, 112, 124, 136],
    [100, 112, 124, 136, 148]
]

- To solve this problem, we can create a function that iterates through each cell in the given grid, calculates the sum of its adjacent cells, and stores the result in a new grid. Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
def sum_adjacent_cells(grid):
    # Get the dimensions of the grid
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    
    # Create a new grid to store the results
    new_grid = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    
    # Define the directions for adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    
    # Iterate through each cell in the grid
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            total = 0
            # Check each direction
            for dr, dc in directions:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                # Check if the new row and column indices are within bounds
                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
                    total += grid[nr][nc]
            new_grid[r][c] = total
    
    return new_grid

# Example usage
grid = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
    [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
    [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
    [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]
]

result = sum_adjacent_cells(grid)
for row in result:
    print(row)
```

When you run this code with the provided `grid`, it will output the new grid where each cell contains the sum of its adjacent cells:

```
[28, 36, 44, 52, 60]
[64, 76, 88, 100, 112]
[76, 88, 100, 112, 124]
[88, 100, 112, 124, 136]
[100, 112, 124, 136, 148]
```

This function works by iterating through each cell in the original grid, checking the four possible adjacent cells (up, down, left, right), and summing their values if they are within the bounds of the grid. The result is stored in a new grid, which is returned at the end.
