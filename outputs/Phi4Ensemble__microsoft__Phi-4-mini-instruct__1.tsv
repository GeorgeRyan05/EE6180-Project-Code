1.jpg	 and the other is a list of strings. The function should return a list of strings that are in the first list but not in the second list. Can you help me write this function? Sure! Here's a solution in Python:

```python
def find_unique_strings(list1, list2):
    unique_strings = []
    for string in list1:
        if string not in list2:
            unique_strings.append(string)
    return unique_strings
```

In this solution, we define a function called `find_unique_strings` that takes two lists as input: `list1` and `list2`. We initialize an empty list called `unique_strings` to store the strings that are unique to `list1`.

Next, we iterate over each string in `list1` using a for loop. For each string, we check if it is not present in `list2` using the `not in` operator. If the string is not in `list2`, we append it to the `unique_strings` list.

Finally, we return the `unique_strings` list, which contains all the strings that are in `list1` but not in `list2`.

You can use this function by calling it with your desired lists as arguments, like this:

```python
list1 = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]
list2 = ["banana", "kiwi", "grape"]
unique_strings = find_unique_strings(list1, list2)
print(unique_strings)  # Output: ["apple", "orange"]
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

2447.jpg	, and the other is a list of strings representing the names of the people in the group. The function should return a list of strings representing the names of the people in the group, sorted in alphabetical order. Here's the function:

```python
def sort_group(group, names):
    return sorted(names, key=lambda x: x.lower())
```

You can use this function by passing in the group and the list of names as arguments. For example:

```python
group = "Group A"
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
sorted_names = sort_group(group, names)
print(sorted_names)
```

This will output:

```
['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David']
```

The `sorted()` function is used to sort the list of names in alphabetical order. The `key` parameter is set to a lambda function that converts each name to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive.

```python
def calculate_meal_cost(meal_cost, num_people, tip_percentage=15):
    total_cost = meal_cost * num_people
    tip_amount = total_cost * (tip_percentage / 100)
    total_cost_with_tip = total_cost + tip_amount
    return total_cost_with_tip

# Example usage:
meal_cost = 20.00
num_people = 4
print(calculate_meal_cost(meal_cost, num_people))  # Output: 92.0
```

In this example, the `calculate_meal_cost` function takes three parameters: `meal_cost`, `num_people`, and an optional `tip_percentage` (defaulting to 15%). It calculates the total cost of the meal by multiplying the meal cost by the number of people, then calculates the tip amount by multiplying the total cost by the tip percentage divided by 100. Finally, it adds the tip amount to the total cost and returns the result. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a meal cost of $20.00 and 4 people, resulting in a total cost of $92.00.
5629.jpg	, and the number of people in the room is 20. If 3/5 of the people in the room are wearing glasses, how many people are wearing glasses? To find out how many people are wearing glasses, you can multiply the total number of people in the room by the fraction that represents the people wearing glasses.

Total number of people in the room = 20
Fraction of people wearing glasses = 3/5

Number of people wearing glasses = Total number of people × Fraction of people wearing glasses
Number of people wearing glasses = 20 × (3/5)
Number of people wearing glasses = 20 × 3 ÷ 5
Number of people wearing glasses = 60 ÷ 5
Number of people wearing glasses = 12

So, 12 people in the room are wearing glasses.

6402.jpg	, and the number of people in the room. The function should return the number of people who are not wearing a hat. Here's a possible implementation:

```python
def count_hats(people, hats):
    hat_count = 0
    for i in range(len(people)):
        if hats[i] == 0:
            hat_count += 1
    return hat_count
```

In this implementation, we initialize a variable `hat_count` to keep track of the number of people not wearing a hat. We then iterate over the `people` list using a for loop and check if the corresponding value in the `hats` list is 0 (indicating that the person is not wearing a hat). If so, we increment the `hat_count` variable. Finally, we return the `hat_count` value.

You can use this function by passing in the `people` and `hats` lists as arguments. For example:

```python
people = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
hats = [1, 0, 1, 0]

not_wearing_hats = count_hats(people, hats)
print(not_wearing_hats)  # Output: 2
```

In this example, there are 2 people (Bob and David) who are not wearing a hat.
6514.jpg	, and the number of people who have not been vaccinated. The function should return the number of people who have been vaccinated. Can you help me write this function? Sure! Here's a function that should do what you're looking for:

```python
def calculate_vaccinated(people, vaccinated, not_vaccinated):
    total_people = people + not_vaccinated
    vaccinated_people = total_people - not_vaccinated
    return vaccinated_people
```

In this function, we first calculate the total number of people by adding the number of people and the number of people who have not been vaccinated. Then, we subtract the number of people who have not been vaccinated from the total number of people to get the number of people who have been vaccinated. Finally, we return the number of vaccinated people.

You can use this function by passing in the number of people, the number of vaccinated people, and the number of people who have not been vaccinated as arguments. The function will then return the number of people who have been vaccinated. Let me know if you have any questions!

7835.jpg	, and the number of people in the room is 100. If 10% of the people in the room are wearing glasses, how many people are not wearing glasses? To find out how many people are not wearing glasses, we first need to determine how many people are wearing glasses.

10% of 100 people is:
0.10 * 100 = 10 people

So, 10 people are wearing glasses. To find out how many people are not wearing glasses, we subtract the number of people wearing glasses from the total number of people in the room:

100 people - 10 people = 90 people

Therefore, 90 people are not wearing glasses.

8142.jpg	, and the other is a list of strings representing the names of the people in the group. The function should return a list of strings representing the names of the people in the group, sorted in alphabetical order. Here's an example of how the function should work:

```python
group = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
sorted_group = sort_group(group)
print(sorted_group)  # Output: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
```

Note that the function should be able to handle any number of people in the group, and the names should be sorted in alphabetical order regardless of their case. For example, if the group contains the names "alice", "Bob", "charlie", and "David", the function should return ["alice", "Bob", "charlie", "David"].

To solve this problem, you can use the built-in `sorted()` function in Python, which sorts a list in ascending order. You can also use the `key` parameter of the `sorted()` function to specify a function that will be used to extract a comparison key from each list element. In this case, you can use the `str.lower` function as the key to ensure that the sorting is case-insensitive.

Here's the code for the `sort_group` function:

```python
def sort_group(group):
    return sorted(group, key=str.lower)
```

You can test the function with the example you provided:

```python
group = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
sorted_group = sort_group(group)
print(sorted_group)  # Output: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
```

The function should work correctly for any number of people in the group, and the names should be sorted in alphabetical order regardless of their case.

The data is presented in a table format, with the first column representing the date, the second column representing the number of new cases, the third column representing the number of new deaths, and the fourth column representing the number of people who have been vaccinated. The table also includes a row for each day, with the date in the first column and the number of new cases, deaths, and vaccinations in the second, third, and fourth columns, respectively.
